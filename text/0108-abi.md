# Summary

ABI defines how to communicate with smart contract. It contains information about contract's receivers, data structures, etc.

# Motivation

ABI is essential tool that allows developers to generate handy bindings, UIs, etc. One of the best consumer usages would be using a DAO and being able to confirm what exactly it is trying to do before signing a transaction.

# Guide

This TEP is based on types that are defined in TLB+ and it advised to know them before reading this TEP.

# Specification

ABI is a JSON file:

```json
{
  "name": "MyContract",
  "types": [
    {
      "name": "MyRequest",
      "header": 12315123,
      "fields": [{ "name": "queryId", "type": "uint64" }]
    }
  ],
  "receivers": [
    { "type": "binary", "kind": "internal", "name": "MyRequest" },
    { "type": "binary", "kind": "internal" },
    { "type": "comment", "kind": "internal", "comment": "Vote!" },
    { "type": "comment", "kind": "internal" },
    { "type": "empty", "kind": "internal" }
  ],
  "getters": [
    { "name": "getOwner", "type": "address", "args": [] },
    { "name": "getBalance", "type": "coins", "args": [{ "name": "invested", "type": "coins" }] }
  ],
  "errors": {
    "123": "Error description",
    "124": "Division by zero"
  }
}
```

# Drawbacks

- Binary and compact representation of ABI could be better, but it is not critical for now.

# Rationale and alternatives

- No alternatives

# Prior art

- Supported interfaces TEP, that is complimentary to this TEP.
