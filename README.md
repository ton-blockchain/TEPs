# TON Enhancement Proposals (TEPs)

> :warning: **WARNING:** this proposal system is experimental now, the process is a subject to change.

The main goal of TON Enhancement Proposals is to provide a convenient and formal way to propose changes to TON Blockchain
and standardize ways of interaction between different parts of ecosystem.

Proposal management is done using GitHub pull requests, the process is described formally in [TEP-1](./text/0001-tep-lifecycle.md).

## Creating TEP
1. Discuss your proposal with community first, for example in TON Dev chat ([en](https://t.me/tondev_eng)/[ru](https://t.me/tondev)).
2. Read [TEP-1](./text/0001-tep-lifecycle.md) to understand proposal management process.
3. Fork this repo and copy `./0000-template.md` to `./text/0000-my-new-standard.md` where "my-new-standard" is a short title of your TEP.
4. Fill all sections and answer questions stated in template. If you need to include images, upload them to `./assets/0000-my-new-standard/` folder.
5. Submit a pull request.

## WIP
Since standard truly become a _Standard_  not when it gets merged into this repository, but when multiple parties accept it and use to interact with each other, below we list proposals to which developers may refer in documentation and so on.
In particular "Status" below has the following sense: 
* "Proposed" - this standard hasn't implementation or implementation is used only by authors
* "Partially Deployed" - this standard is used by pair of actors (for instance one dApp and one wallet, or similar), but not by interconnected set of actors
* "Deployed" - this standard is used by multiple actors (and generally should be on the way of merging)
